# 🌱 BioSage - AI-Driven Farming Assistant

## 🚀 Overview
**BioSage** is an AI-powered farming assistant designed to revolutionize modern agriculture. It provides farmers with intelligent recommendations for crops, fertilizers, and disease management, alongside a community-driven platform for real-time discussions and a multilingual interface for accessibility.

## ✨ Features
- **🌾 Crop Recommendation**: AI-based suggestions for optimal crop selection based on soil conditions.
- **🌿 Fertilizer Recommendation**: Smart analysis to recommend the best fertilizers for increased yield.
- **🦠 Crop Disease Prediction**: Image-based disease detection using deep learning models.
- **👨‍🌾 Farmer's Community**: A dedicated forum for farmers to connect, share insights, and solve challenges.
- **🌎 Language Translation**: Breaking barriers with multi-language support for global accessibility.
- **🟤 3D Soil Analysis**: Crop-Recommendation based on the soil attributes from a 3D Model.
- **🛞 The Crop Wheel**: Suugests varied crops based on different seasons selected by the User in the Wheel.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, Vanilla CSS, JS, Three.js
- **Machine Learning**: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Panda, NumPy, Keras, Matplotlib
- **Cloud Services**: Streamlit, Vercel

## 📝 Research Paper

> This project is based on the research paper published on IEEE. You can find the paper at the following link:

- [IEEE : Smart Crop Recommendation System with Plant Disease Identification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738975)

## 📊 Results

- Seven classification algorithms were evaluated for crop recommendation tasks.
- The accuracy of each algorithm was assessed, with the Random Forest algorithm achieving the highest accuracy of 99.55%.
- Table 1 below illustrates the accuracy achieved by each algorithm:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 99.55% in crop recommendation, making it the most reliable model for this system.
