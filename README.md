# üå± BioSage - AI-Driven Farming Assistant

## üöÄ Overview
**BioSage** is an AI-powered farming assistant designed to revolutionize modern agriculture. It provides farmers with intelligent recommendations for crops, fertilizers, and disease management, alongside a community-driven platform for real-time discussions and a multilingual interface for accessibility.

## ‚ú® Features
- **üåæ Crop Recommendation**: AI-based suggestions for optimal crop selection based on soil conditions.
- **üåø Fertilizer Recommendation**: Smart analysis to recommend the best fertilizers for increased yield.
- **ü¶† Crop Disease Prediction**: Image-based disease detection using deep learning models.
- **üë®‚Äçüåæ Farmer's Community**: A dedicated forum for farmers to connect, share insights, and solve challenges.
- **üåé Language Translation**: Breaking barriers with multi-language support for global accessibility.
- **üü§ 3D Soil Analysis**: Crop-Recommendation based on the soil attributes from a 3D Model.
- **üõû The Crop Wheel**: Suugests varied crops based on different seasons selected by the User in the Wheel.
- **üí∞ Crop Price Prediction**: AI-driven market analysis that forecasts crop prices based on historical trends, demand-supply patterns, and external factors, empowering farmers to make informed selling decisions and maximize profits.
- **üì± Android Support**: A fully optimized mobile application that allows farmers to access all features seamlessly, ensuring real-time updates, easy navigation, and offline support for uninterrupted farming assistance.

## üìù Research Paper

> This project is based on the research paper published on IEEE. You can find the paper at the following link:

- [IEEE : Smart Crop Recommendation System with Plant Disease Identification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738975)

## üìä Results

- Seven classification algorithms were evaluated for crop recommendation tasks.
- The accuracy of each algorithm was assessed, with the Random Forest algorithm achieving the highest accuracy of 99.55%.
- Table 1 below illustrates the accuracy achieved by each algorithm:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 99.55% in crop recommendation, making it the most reliable model for this system.

**Table 1: Accuracy vs Algorithms**

| Algorithm            | Accuracy   |
